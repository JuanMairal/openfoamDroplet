# openfoamDroplet
This contains all working openfoam cases for my MSc project. I list all of them after the acknowledgements.


My sincere gratitude goes to Dr. Jozsef Nagy whose tutorials have helped me in this project.  All of these cases have been developed from Jozsef Nagy's base two-phase tutorial, which can be found here: https://wiki.openfoam.com/Multiphase_(VOF)_Simulation_Project_by_Jozsef_Nagy.

I appreciate the help and guidance I have received from Dr. Lennon O'Naraigh from the University College Dublin all throughout this project.


This repository contains, for now, a series of 2D OpenFOAM cases
